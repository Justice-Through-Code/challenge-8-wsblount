### Estimated Time to Complete

40 minutes

---

### Learning Objectives

Start building your own functions!

---

### Assignment Overview

Follow the instructions in `library.py` to complete this challenge. 

NOTE: Now that we know how to write our own functions, our tests don't always need to match exactly! We can test the output of your _functions_ based on test inputs rather than checking your print statements. Make sure that you're running your own code (ex: `python3 library.py`) to see what your code is outputting!

## Summary

0. Accept the challenge via the GitHub Classroom link (if you're already here, you've done this part!)
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Follow the instructions in `library.py`
3. From the main folder of the challenge, run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest` to see if your code works as expected
4. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your code, and look for the little green check mark on your repo that tells you your tests passed

And you're all set!
